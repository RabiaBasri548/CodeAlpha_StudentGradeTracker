CodeAlpha Internship – Java Task 1

🧑‍💻 Project Name: Student Grade Tracker

📄 Description:
The Student Grade Tracker is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to input names and grades of multiple students. It then calculates and displays the average grade, the highest and lowest grades, and shows a list of all students with their corresponding grades.

This project helps beginners understand how to use Java classes, objects, ArrayLists, and loops to create a dynamic and interactive program that mimics a basic academic record system.

🎯 Features:
- Input names and grades of students
- Calculate average grade
- Identify and display:
  - Student with the highest grade
  - Student with the lowest grade
- Display all student records in a clean list

🔧 Technologies Used:
- Java (JDK 17+)
- ArrayList for dynamic storage
- Scanner for input handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📚 Learning Outcomes:
- Practice with Java classes and objects
- Understand how to use loops and collections
- Improve problem-solving and logic building
- Develop basic CLI (Command-Line Interface) apps

👨‍🎓 Internship Program:
This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Virtual Internship Program in Java Development. The focus was on applying core Java skills to solve real-world-like problems with clean and well-structured code.
